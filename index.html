          I have authored 251 publications in total (by April 2024), including 1 doctorial thesis, 2 edited conference proceedings, 3 book chapters, 107 refereed journal articles, 117 refereed conference papers, 19 journal special issue editorials and conference welcome messages, and 2 conference abstracts. 
          <br>Several commonly used metrics are used to indicate the quality of the refereed publications. Two JCR (Journal Citation ReportsTM) metrics including Journal Impact Factor (IF) and its corresponding Quartile (Q) are used to show the influence and impact of journals. All the 107 journal articles are SCI/SCIE indexed, with 91 ranked Q1. The two JCR indicators are shown for all journals.  The CORE (Computing Research and Education Association of Australasia) ranking is used to indicate the quality of conferences in my field (46 Information and Computing Sciences), with CORE A* and A indicating the quality at a flagship and excellent level, respectively. Since there are several versions of ranking, the highest level a publication has been ranked is used herein. Only CORE A* and A rankings are displayed for succinctness. I have 61 conference papers ranked CORE A*/A. The acceptance rate of a CORE A* conference is also provided to further demonstrate the selectivity. Besides, the papers receiving awards are also indicated.
          <br>In terms of Google Scholar Citations, my publications have attracted 9500+ citations, with an h-index of 51. In the following list of publications, the citation count is shown for a publication having at least 20 citations

          I have received 13 prestigious awards, prizes, or fellowships in total, listed below with their basic information and the quality justification for some items.
          <ul class="justified-text">
            <li>2021, ARC DECRA Fellowship (2021 – 2023), Australian Research Council. This prestigious award is very competitive with a low selection rate of 17.1% for the 2021 round.</li>
            <li>2021, Highly Cited Researcher in the Computer Science Discipline, Clarivate. Only about 0.1% of the world’s researchers earned this exclusive distinction in 2021.</li>
            <li>2019, Early-Career Research Excellence Award (ECREA), University of Auckland. There are only six recipients across the whole university receiving this prestigious award in the 2019 round.</li>

          <p class="justified-text">
            At both MQ and the University of Auckland, I have substantially engaged in designing, developing, convening and/or teaching several units, listed below. Even during my ARC DECRA fellowship (2021~2023), I still actively contributed to teaching through lecturing computing units and playing the leadership roles (Program Leader during 2020~2022 and Course Director since 2023) for the highly demanding security discipline. The team-based teaching approach is adopted, where usually two staffs co-teach a unit, so the weeks I took are indicated where appropriate.
